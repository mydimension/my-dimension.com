		<h1>Welcome To The Journal O&#39; Andy</h1>

		<p>Well.. I&#39;m not at work today, because I have today off. Its actually kind of nice.. except for the problem that theres nothing to do around here.<br />
		Crystal was suppsed to call me last night but unfortunately she didn't. She says her grandma took her phone away from her. *Unhappy*<br />
		I&#39;ll forgive her later when she logs on later today, I can wait to talk to her about going out bowling. I&#39;m still wondering how well she bowls.</p>
		
		<p>Not much is going to go on today, I have to do my work clothes in the laundry and clean up my appartment a bit more, because its still a total wreck.<br />
		I just <em>LOVE</em> cleaning. It is so much fun I could do it all day. * Note for everyone out there.. this is heavy sarcasm. *</p>
		
		<p>My day will probably be filled with music curtisy of GamingFM, which now happens to be my favorite thing to listen to as I&#39;m home.<br />
		Gaming FM is a Shoutcast Winamp Station that broadcasts nothing, nothing but gaming music 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.<br />
		Granted some of them get annoying ( like the one thats playing now: Grand Theft Auto 3&#39;s Lazlo&#39;s &#34;Leslie Conversation&#34; ) but some of the other ones are great.<br />
		I Am The Wind from Castlevania Symphony of The Night, by Rika Muranaka has quickly become one of my favorite songs to listen to.. maybe I&#39;ll shove the lyrics up in the Other Stuff catagory later tonight.</p>
		
		<p>Other than that, I&#39;ve been chilling out with the DPC crew as I usally do, on their chat channel, and not doing much else.</p>
		
		<p>Today is probably going to be a very very slow day.</p>
		
		<p>I&#39;ll get back writing later.</p>
